<p>Our strategy is built around collaborating with young talent, fostering their holistic growth in encouraging settings, and giving them with avenues to realize their full potential both on and off the field.</p>
<center><h2>PARTNERING WITH TALENT</h2></center>
<p>Our strategy is based on the idea that talent can be found anywhere, which is why we don't just focus on traditional talent hotspots. No matter where they are, our scouts are trained to spot young athletes with excellent football skills, academic promise, and the proper character. Talent, in our opinion, is a universal quality, but opportunity is not. We scout over 100,000 children annually as part of our scouting network, which includes over 180 towns, in an effort to identify skills that may go unnoticed by others.</p>
<center><h2>NURTURING ENVIRONMENTS</h2></center>
<p>After partnering with talents, we place them in nurturing surroundings where they can realize their full potential both on and off the field. We are dedicated to provide our young student-athletes with a holistic education through a revolutionary program that combines character development, academic structure, and elite football training. Our all-encompassing approach unlocks their potential and puts them on the right track to realizing their goals, not just in football but in every area of their lives.</p>
<center><h2>PATHWAYS</h2></center>
<p>We think there are several ways to be exceptional. And we're here to give our dreamers the resources they need to forge their own paths, whether they take them to the field, the classroom, or somewhere else entirely. Thus, following over the years with us, they decide on their career path:</p>
<ol>
<li>PRO FOOTBALL - With a track record that places us among the top 12 in the world for producing players for the world's greatest leagues, we have established a reputation for producing elite young footballers.The core of our journey to playing professional football is our football academy. For young players from all of our markets who are eager to begin their professional football careers, it offers a two-year, unmatched football development program. It offers them a one-of-a-kind chance for in-depth, exceptional instruction that will provide them the knowledge and experience they need to excel in their careers.</li>
<li>EDUCATION - We’re not just about football - we're about empowering young, talented student-athletes to chase their dreams on and off the field! That's why we link our student-athletes who are excelling in their academics and meeting our character development milestones with top scholarship opportunities in the US and UK. And ever since our first student-athlete landed a scholarship in 2004, we’ve built a network of partnerships with some of the world’s top high schools, colleges, and universities. Our education pathway gives our high-achieving girls and boys the chance to chase their dreams and become the next generation of leaders, while football remains a key part of their journey.</li>
